This repository contains a functional AIMMS example model for **Contract Allocation**. It demonstrates how to optimize the distribution of demand across various supply contracts while minimizing costs and satisfying business constraints.

## 🎯 Business Problem

In complex supply chains, managing multiple procurement contracts with different pricing tiers, minimum/maximum commitments, and geographical constraints is a challenge. This model helps decision-makers:
- Minimize total procurement costs.
- Respect contractual obligations.
- Balance supply and demand efficiently.
